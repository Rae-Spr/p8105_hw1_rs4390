# Problem 1


```{r load data}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
 library(tidyverse)
```

## Dataset description
The penguins dataset contains `r nrow(penguins)` observations of individual penguins. There are `r ncol(penguins)` total variables that detail the penguins' physical dimensions, sex, year, species, and island. 

The penguins in the dataset are from 3 islands (Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen), 3 years (2007, 2008, and 2009), and represent 3 species (Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo). The other variables include: bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex. The mean flipper length of the dataset is `r round(mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE))` mm.
