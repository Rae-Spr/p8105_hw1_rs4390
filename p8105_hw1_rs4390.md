# Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Dataset description

The penguins dataset contains 344 observations of individual penguins.
There are 8 total variables that detail the penguins’ physical
dimensions, sex, year, species, and island.

The penguins in the dataset are from 3 islands (Biscoe, Dream, and
Torgersen), 3 years (2007, 2008, and 2009), and represent 3 species
(Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo). The other variables include: bill
length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex. The mean flipper
length of the dataset is 201 mm.

# Problem 2

## New data frame

``` r
hw1_df = 
  hw1_df = tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(10), 
    norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0, 
    var_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
    var_factor = factor(c("male", "female", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "female", "nonbinary")),
  )

x <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J")
vectorLength = length(x)
cat("Length of vector x is :", vectorLength)
```

    ## Length of vector x is : 10

``` r
y <- c("male", "female", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "female", "nonbinary")
vectorLength = length(y)
cat("Length of vector y is :", vectorLength)
```

    ## Length of vector y is : 10

I created a data frame comprised of:

-   a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution with
    `rnorm`
-   a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0 with `norm_samp_pos`
-   a character vector of length 10 with `var_char`
-   a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels” with
    `var_factor`

## Taking mean of each variable
