# Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Dataset description

The penguins dataset contains 344 observations of individual penguins.
There are 8 total variables that detail the penguins’ physical
dimensions, sex, year, species, and island.

The penguins in the dataset are from 3 islands (Biscoe, Dream, and
Torgersen), 3 years (2007, 2008, and 2009), and represent 3 species
(Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo). The other variables include: bill
length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex. The mean flipper
length of the dataset is 201 mm.

# Problem 2

## New data frame

``` r
hw1_df = 
  hw1_df = tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(10), 
    norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0, 
    var_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
    var_factor = factor(c("male", "female", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "female", "nonbinary")),
  )

x <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J")
vectorLength = length(x)
cat("Length of vector x is :", vectorLength)
```

    ## Length of vector x is : 10

``` r
y <- c("male", "female", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "female", "nonbinary")
vectorLength = length(y)
cat("Length of vector y is :", vectorLength)
```

    ## Length of vector y is : 10

I created a data frame comprised of:

-   a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution with
    `rnorm`
-   a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0 with `norm_samp_pos`
-   a character vector of length 10 with `var_char`
-   a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels” with
    `var_factor`

## Taking mean of each variable

### Mean of norm_samp

``` r
mean (pull (hw1_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.1265389

### Mean of norm_samp_pos

``` r
mean (pull (hw1_df, norm_samp_pos))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

### Mean of var_char

``` r
mean (pull (hw1_df, var_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, var_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

### Mean of var_factor

``` r
mean (pull (hw1_df, var_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, var_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

*Outcome*: I was able to take the mean of `norm_samp` since it is a
numeric variable. Surprisingly, I was also able to take the mean of
`norm_samp_pos` even though that variable is logical and not numeric. I
was not able to take the mean of `var_factor` or `var_char` because both
are factor and character variables, respectively.

## Applying as.numeric

``` r
var_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J")
V <- factor(var_char)
as.numeric (V) 

var_factor = factor(c("male", "female", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "female", "nonbinary"))
as.numeric (var_factor)

norm_samp = rnorm(10)
norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0
as.numeric(norm_samp_pos)
```

*Outcome*: In order to convert the character variable into a numeric
variable via `as.numeric`, I had to first convert the character variable
into a factor variable. Character variables are string variables, but
when converted to a factor, they are given factor levels which then
correspond to numeric outputs (ex. outputs 1, 2, and 3 based on the
three factor levels “male”, “female”, and “nonbinary”). This works
because factor variables are categorical, meaning they have a finite,
predefined number of categories/levels depending on the dataset. In this
case, our factor variable has 3 categories/levels (“male”, “female”, and
“nonbinary”).

Logical variables like `norm_samp_pos` only have two levels/categories
because it is a binary variable. The only options are 0 or 1 (true or
false). That is why you can immediately take the mean of a logical
variable because it has an inherent numeric value, whereas factor
variables first have to be converted into numeric values via
`as.numeric` before the mean can be taken. When converted to numeric
values, the factor levels will then correspond to numeric outputs as
seen in this example.
